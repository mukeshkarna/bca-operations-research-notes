Here are 2 balanced and 2 unbalanced questions each for the North West Corner method, Least Cost method, and Vogel's Approximation method:

## North West Corner Method Questions

### Balanced Problems:
1. A company has three factories (A, B, C) and four warehouses (W, X, Y, Z). The monthly production capacities of factories A, B, and C are 300, 400, and 500 units respectively. The monthly requirements of warehouses W, X, Y, and Z are 200, 300, 250, and 450 units respectively. Use the North West Corner method to find the initial basic feasible solution for this transportation problem.

2. Three suppliers P, Q, and R supply goods to four retail outlets S, T, U, and V. The supplies available at P, Q, and R are 120, 80, and 100 units respectively. The demands at S, T, U, and V are 60, 70, 90, and 80 units respectively. Use the North West Corner method to determine the initial allocation and calculate the transportation cost if the unit transportation costs (in $) are:
   ```
   To:  S  T  U  V
   P:  10 12  9 11
   Q:   8 10 11  7
   R:  14  9 12 10
   ```

### Unbalanced Problems:
1. Two manufacturers X and Y have production capacities of 150 and 200 units per month. Three retailers P, Q, and R require 80, 130, and 170 units per month. Find the initial basic feasible solution using the North West Corner method for this unbalanced transportation problem.

2. A company manufactures products at three plants A, B, and C with capacities of 50, 70, and 30 units per week respectively. These products are to be shipped to four distribution centers W, X, Y, and Z with weekly demands of 25, 35, 40, and 30 units respectively. Use the North West Corner method to obtain the initial basic feasible solution for this unbalanced transportation problem.

## Least Cost Method Questions

### Balanced Problems:
1. A company has three warehouses (W1, W2, W3) and four retail stores (S1, S2, S3, S4). The supply capacities of warehouses W1, W2, and W3 are 15, 25, and 10 units respectively. The demand requirements of stores S1, S2, S3, and S4 are 5, 15, 15, and 15 units respectively. Use the Least Cost method to determine the optimal allocation if the transportation costs per unit (in $) are:
   ```
   To:  S1  S2  S3  S4
   W1:  10   2    8   11
   W2:   7   9    4    5
   W3:   3   8    7    9
   ```

2. Three sources A, B, and C have supplies of 12, 17, and 11 units. Four destinations P, Q, R, and S have demands of 10, 8, 12, and 10 units respectively. Use the Least Cost method to determine the initial allocation with the following cost matrix:
   ```
   To:  P   Q   R   S
   A:   6   8   4   9
   B:   3   2   5   4
   C:   5   7   6   8
   ```

### Unbalanced Problems:
1. A company has two production plants P1 and P2 with production capacities of 200 and 300 units. There are three warehouses W1, W2, and W3 with demands of 150, 200, and 100 units. Find the initial basic feasible solution using the Least Cost method with the following transportation costs per unit:
   ```
   To:  W1  W2  W3
   P1:  8   6   10
   P2:  5   4    9
   ```

2. Four factories F1, F2, F3, and F4 manufacture the same product with monthly capacities of 40, 70, 90, and 30 units respectively. These products are to be shipped to three warehouses W1, W2, and W3 with monthly requirements of 50, 110, and 60 units respectively. Use the Least Cost method to determine the initial basic feasible solution with the following transportation costs (in $):
   ```
   To:  W1  W2  W3
   F1:  2   7    9
   F2:  5   8    6
   F3:  3   4    7
   F4:  6   9    3
   ```

## Vogel's Approximation Method Questions

### Balanced Problems:
1. A manufacturing company has three plants A, B, and C with monthly production capacities of 100, 80, and 90 units respectively. These products are shipped to four warehouses W, X, Y, and Z with monthly requirements of 70, 50, 70, and 80 units respectively. Use Vogel's Approximation Method to find the initial basic feasible solution with the following transportation costs per unit:
   ```
   To:  W   X   Y   Z
   A:   3   2   7   6
   B:   7   5   2   3
   C:   2   5   4   5
   ```

2. Three offices (O1, O2, O3) need to send documents to four branches (B1, B2, B3, B4). The number of documents available at offices O1, O2, and O3 are 30, 40, and 30 respectively. The number of documents required at branches B1, B2, B3, and B4 are 20, 30, 25, and 25 respectively. Use Vogel's Approximation Method to determine the initial allocation with the following cost matrix (in $):
   ```
   To:  B1  B2  B3  B4
   O1:  8   5   6   8
   O2:  15  10  9   10
   O3:  5   12  8   6
   ```

### Unbalanced Problems:
1. A company manufactures products at two plants P1 and P2 with daily capacities of 150 and 200 units respectively. These products are to be shipped to three warehouses W1, W2, and W3 with daily requirements of 100, 150, and 50 units respectively. Use Vogel's Approximation Method to obtain the initial basic feasible solution with the following transportation costs (in $):
   ```
   To:  W1  W2  W3
   P1:  5   3   8
   P2:  4   7   6
   ```

2. Four suppliers S1, S2, S3, and S4 have stocks of 80, 60, 70, and 40 units respectively. Three customers C1, C2, and C3 require 90, 120, and 50 units respectively. Use Vogel's Approximation Method to find the initial basic feasible solution if the transportation costs per unit are:
   ```
   To:  C1  C2  C3
   S1:  4   5   3
   S2:  6   8   5
   S3:  7   4   6

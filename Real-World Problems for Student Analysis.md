1. Hospital Emergency Department Scheduling
"City Hospital's emergency department is struggling with long patient wait times, especially during peak hours (evenings and weekends). They have 20 doctors and 40 nurses with different specialties and availability constraints. How should they schedule staff to minimize patient wait times while keeping labor costs within budget?"

2. University Course Scheduling
"Our university needs to assign 150 courses to 50 classrooms with different capacities across campus. Some courses have special requirements (labs, projectors, etc.). How can we create a schedule that minimizes student travel time between classes while ensuring all requirements are met?"

3. Food Bank Distribution
"A regional food bank receives donations from 30 sources and needs to distribute them to 45 community centers. Each center has different needs, and some food items are perishable. How should they plan their distribution network to maximize the amount of food delivered while minimizing waste?"

4. Public Transit Route Optimization
"The city bus system has 25 buses operating on 8 routes. Ridership varies significantly by time of day and location. How should routes and schedules be designed to minimize passenger wait times while staying within the operational budget?"

5. Factory Production Mix
"A furniture manufacturer produces tables, chairs, and bookcases using limited wood, labor, and machine time resources. Tables provide $120 profit, chairs $50, and bookcases $200. How should they allocate resources to maximize profit?"

6. Airline Fleet Assignment
"An airline has 5 different aircraft types with different capacities and operating costs. They serve 35 routes with varying demand patterns. How should they assign aircraft to routes to maximize profitability?"

7. Delivery Vehicle Routing
"A local delivery service has 8 vehicles and needs to make deliveries to 120 locations across the city, with time windows when customers are available. How should they plan routes to minimize total distance traveled while meeting all time window constraints?"

8. Hospital Bed Management
"A 300-bed hospital struggles with bed allocation across departments (surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc.). Patient arrivals are somewhat unpredictable, and length of stay varies by condition. How should they manage bed allocation to minimize the number of patients who must wait for a bed?"

9. Inventory Management for Retail
"A clothing retailer has 500 products across 12 stores. Demand varies by season, location, and product. Storage space is limited, and ordering too much results in markdowns. How should they determine order quantities and timing for each product and location?"

10. Call Center Staffing
"A customer service call center receives calls that vary in volume throughout the day and week. They have full-time staff who work 8-hour shifts and part-time staff available for 4-hour shifts. How should they schedule staff to ensure 90% of calls are answered within 3 minutes while minimizing labor costs?"

Below is a detailed step-by-step solution for the Restaurant ABC Analysis example, showing all formulas and calculations clearly.I've provided a complete step-by-step solution for the Restaurant ABC Analysis example. Here are the key points to understand:

## Key Formulas Used:
1. **Annual Value = Annual Usage × Cost per unit**
2. **% of Total Value = (Item Annual Value / Total Annual Value) × 100**
3. **Cumulative % = Previous Cumulative % + Current Item %**
4. **% of Items = (1 / Total Number of Items) × 100**

## Classification Process:
1. **Calculate annual value** for each item
2. **Sort items** in descending order of annual value
3. **Calculate percentages** and cumulative percentages
4. **Apply ABC rules**:
   - A Items: ~70-80% of value (usually 10-20% of items)
   - B Items: ~15-20% of value (usually ~30% of items)  
   - C Items: ~5-10% of value (usually 50-60% of items)

## Final Results:
- **A Items:** 5 items (33.33%) representing 75.50% of value ($124,500)

**Formula Used:**
% of Total Value = (Item Annual Value / Total Annual Value) × 100

**Calculations:**
1. Beef: (50,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 30.32%
2. Salmon: (28,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 16.98%
3. Chicken: (24,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 14.55%
4. Lobster: (12,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 7.28%
5. Pork: (10,500 / 164,900) × 100 = 6.37%
6. Shrimp: (9,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 5.46%
7. Flour: (7,500 / 164,900) × 100 = 4.55%
8. Cheese: (6,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 3.64%
9. Tomatoes: (5,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 3.03%
10. Potatoes: (4,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 2.43%
11. Rice: (3,600 / 164,900) × 100 = 2.18%
12. Onions: (2,400 / 164,900) × 100 = 1.46%
13. Oil: (2,000 / 164,900) × 100 = 1.21%
14. Salt: (500 / 164,900) × 100 = 0.30%
15. Pepper: (400 / 164,900) × 100 = 0.24%

## Step 5: Calculate Cumulative Percentage of Value

**Formula Used:**
Cumulative % = Previous Cumulative % + Current Item %

**Calculations:**
1. Beef: 30.32% (first item, so cumulative = individual %)
2. Salmon: 30.32% + 16.98% = 47.30%
3. Chicken: 47.30% + 14.55% = 61.85%
4. Lobster: 61.85% + 7.28% = 69.13%
5. Pork: 69.13% + 6.37% = 75.50%
6. Shrimp: 75.50% + 5.46% = 80.96%
7. Flour: 80.96% + 4.55% = 85.51%
8. Cheese: 85.51% + 3.64% = 89.15%
9. Tomatoes: 89.15% + 3.03% = 92.18%
10. Potatoes: 92.18% + 2.43% = 94.61%
11. Rice: 94.61% + 2.18% = 96.79%
12. Onions: 96.79% + 1.46% = 98.25%
13. Oil: 98.25% + 1.21% = 99.46%
14. Salt: 99.46% + 0.30% = 99.76%
15. Pepper: 99.76% + 0.24% = 100.00%

## Step 6: Calculate Percentage of Items

**Formula Used:**
% of Items = (1 / Total Number of Items) × 100

**Calculation:**
Total items = 15
% of Items per item = (1/15) × 100 = 6.67% (each item represents 6.67% of total items)

## Step 7: Calculate Cumulative Percentage of Items

**Formula Used:**
Cumulative % of Items = (Current Item Position / Total Items) × 100

**Calculations:**
1. Beef: (1/15) × 100 = 6.67%
2. Salmon: (2/15) × 100 = 13.33%
3. Chicken: (3/15) × 100 = 20.00%
4. Lobster: (4/15) × 100 = 26.67%
5. Pork: (5/15) × 100 = 33.33%
6. Shrimp: (6/15) × 100 = 40.00%
7. Flour: (7/15) × 100 = 46.67%
8. Cheese: (8/15) × 100 = 53.33%
9. Tomatoes: (9/15) × 100 = 60.00%
10. Potatoes: (10/15) × 100 = 66.67%
11. Rice: (11/15) × 100 = 73.33%
12. Onions: (12/15) × 100 = 80.00%
13. Oil: (13/15) × 100 = 86.67%
14. Salt: (14/15) × 100 = 93.33%
15. Pepper: (15/15) × 100 = 100.00%

## Step 9: ABC Classification Rules

**Standard ABC Classification Guidelines:**
- **A Items:** Top 10-20% of items that represent 70-80% of total value
- **B Items:** Next 30% of items that represent 15-20% of total value  
- **C Items:** Remaining 50-60% of items that represent 5-10% of total value

## Step 10: Apply Classification to Our Data

Looking at our cumulative percentages:

### A Items Classification:
Looking for items that represent approximately 70-80% of value:
- At 5 items (33.33% of items): We have 75.50% of value
- This is close to the 70-80% target

**A Items:** Beef, Salmon, Chicken, Lobster, Pork
- **Number of items:** 5 out of 15 (33.33% of items)
- **Value represented:** 75.50% of total value
- **Dollar value:** $50,000 + $28,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 + $10,500 = $124,500

### B Items Classification:
Next group that adds approximately 15-20% more value:
- From 6th to 9th items: 80.96% to 92.18% = additional 11.22% of value
- This gives us 4 items (26.67% of total items)

**B Items:** Shrimp, Flour, Cheese, Tomatoes
- **Number of items:** 4 out of 15 (26.67% of items)  
- **Value represented:** 92.18% - 75.50% = 16.68% of total value
- **Dollar value:** $9,000 + $7,500 + $6,000 + $5,000 = $27,500

### C Items Classification:
Remaining items:
- From 10th to 15th items: 92.18% to 100% = remaining 7.82% of value

**C Items:** Potatoes, Rice, Onions, Oil, Salt, Pepper
- **Number of items:** 6 out of 15 (40.00% of items)
- **Value represented:** 100% - 92.18% = 7.82% of total value  
- **Dollar value:** $4,000 + $3,600 + $2,400 + $2,000 + $500 + $400 = $12,900

## Step 11: Final ABC Classification Summary

| Category | Items | % of Items | % of Value | Dollar Value | Item Names |
|----------|-------|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| A | 5 | 33.33% | 75.50% | $124,500 | Beef, Salmon, Chicken, Lobster, Pork |
| B | 4 | 26.67% | 16.68% | $27,500 | Shrimp, Flour, Cheese, Tomatoes |
| C | 6 | 40.00% | 7.82% | $12,900 | Potatoes, Rice, Onions, Oil, Salt, Pepper |
| **Total** | **15** | **100%** | **100%** | **$164,900** | **All Items** |

## Step 12: Management Implications

### A Items (High Priority Control):
- **Daily inventory monitoring**
- **Accurate demand forecasting**
- **Multiple suppliers for security**
- **Low safety stock (expensive to hold)**
- **Management attention required**
- **Tight controls on ordering**

### B Items (Moderate Control):
- **Weekly inventory reviews**
- **Standard reorder procedures**
- **Moderate safety stock**
- **Regular supplier evaluation**
- **Systematic control procedures**

### C Items (Simple Control):
- **Monthly inventory reviews**
- **Bulk ordering to minimize ordering costs**
- **High safety stock acceptable**
- **Simple reorder systems (min-max)**
- **Focus on reducing ordering frequency**

This classification helps the restaurant focus their inventory management efforts where they will have the most financial impact.

The key insight is that just 5 ingredients (Beef, Salmon, Chicken, Lobster, Pork) account for over 75% of the restaurant's ingredient costs, so these require the most careful inventory management attention.
